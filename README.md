# Snakey
Revitalising a retro competitive snake game into a game meant for chilling and deep thoughts.


# Gameplay
I'm sure this needs no introduction but just in case:

  Hunt the randomly generated "rays of joy" as a Snakey.

  Control the gameplay with the arrow keys.

  Game ends when you crash into yourself.

# Technologies employed

HTML (canvas API)

CSS (SASS)

Javascript (Web APIs - DOM, event)
