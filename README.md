# Snakey
Revitalising a retro snake game on Nokia phones.


# Gameplay
I'm sure this needs no introduction but just in case:

  Hunt the randomly generated food as a snake.

  Control the gameplay with the arrow keys.

  The more food you eat, the higher points you get.

  Game ends when you crash into yourself.

  Beat the highscore and get on the leaderboard.
